* lsp-julia

A elgot-jl clone project, but use lsp-mode.

The first time ~lsp~ is run, the Julia language server will
be downloaded and installed into the default depot (e.g. =~/.julia=)
in its own isolated project environment. This may take a long time...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'lsp-julia)
  (add-hook 'julia-mode-hook 'lsp)
#+end_src
